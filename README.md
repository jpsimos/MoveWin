# MoveWin
A utility to move any window to a desired position on the desktop. Useful for multiple monitors or remote desktop that has multiple monitors.

If you have more than one monitor and frequently switch the input on one of them, it can be annoying when programs place themselves
outside of the field of accessability. This utility provides the means to get the desired open windows to a position of your choosing
without having to switch inputs just for that.

I havent attached a license to this project because I hope it will help at least one person become a better one.
